## Implementation Notes

### Database:
- Store `total_credits` and `credits_used` per user
- Calculate `credits_remaining` = `total_credits - credits_used`
- Track credit consumption in `usage_logs` table

### License Key Validation:
- Verify license with Gumroad API
- On first use: Create user with appropriate credit package
- On subsequent use: Load user from database

### Credit Deduction:
- Deduct credits BEFORE generation starts
- If generation fails, refund credits automatically
- Log all credit transactions for transparency

### Multiple Purchases:
- Allow users to buy multiple packages
- Add credits cumulatively: `total_credits += new_credits`
- Track each purchase in `license_purchases` table
